# GDALDemoReadNetCore

**GDALDemoReadNetCore** is a simple .net core console application that utilizes GDAL/OGR library and demonstartes how to get some information from spatial data source.

In order to run this application successfully you have to download and unzip native binaries to some filder and add path to *%LIB_ROOT%\bin* and *%LIB_ROOT%\bin\gdal\csharp* directories into PATH system environment variable. I've run this application on Windows platform.
